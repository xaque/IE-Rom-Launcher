# ActiveX Rom Launcher

This is a rom launcher I made that uses IE as a frontend and ActiveX to access the filesystem. There are so many reasons to not use this. Please don't use this. I just made this for myself, and it worked for what I wanted while I was still on Windows. It's also not very portable, so you may have a hard time getting it working.

I never found a emulator front-end that does what I want effectively, so I made my own as a fun side project.
